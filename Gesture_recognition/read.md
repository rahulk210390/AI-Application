In this project, we had build a model to recognise 5 hand gestures. 
We had accomplished the following in the project:

Generator:  The generator should be able to take a batch of videos as input without any error. 
Steps like cropping, resizing and normalization have been performed successfully.

Model: Developed a model that is able to train without any errors which will be judged on the total number of parameters 
(as the inference(prediction) time should be less) and the accuracy achieved. 
That's why, we had started training on a small amount of data and then proceed further.
The most optimal model has been attached with the dataset. You can apply the logic on the dataset available on kaggle for hand gesture.
